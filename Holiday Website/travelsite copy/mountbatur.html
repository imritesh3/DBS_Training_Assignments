      Mount Batur (Gunung Batur) is an active volcano located at the center of
      two concentric calderas north west of Mount Agung on the island of Bali,
      Indonesia. The south east side of the larger 10Ã—13 km caldera contains a
      caldera lake. The inner 7.5-kilometer-wide caldera, which was formed
      during emplacement of the Bali (or Ubud) ignimbrite, has been dated at
      about 23,670 and 28,500 years ago.
