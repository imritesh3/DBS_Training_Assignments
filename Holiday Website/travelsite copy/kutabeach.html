      Kuta is a tourist area, administratively an urban village (kelurahan), and
      the capital of Kuta District, Badung Regency, southern Bali, Indonesia. A
      former fishing village, it was one of the first towns on Bali to see
      substantial tourist development, and as a beach resort remains one of
      Indonesia's major tourist destinations. It is known internationally for
      its long sandy beach, varied accommodation, many restaurants and bars, and
      many renowned surfers who visit from Australia. It is located near Bali's
      Ngurah Rai Airport.
