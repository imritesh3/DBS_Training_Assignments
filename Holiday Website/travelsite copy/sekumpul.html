      Sekumpul Waterfall is touted as the most beautiful waterfall in Bali. It
      is fairly close to Niagara Falls Lemukih, only about 2 km away.
      Understandably, the Village and Village Lemukih Sekumpul indeed neighbors.
      To see Sekumpul Waterfall close, it takes a bit of effort and struggle.
      From the parking lot, you have to walk quite far away, down a dirt road,
      down the hundreds of stairs, and across the river. When you ride a
      motorcycle, you can still ride from the parking lot (near the ticket
      window), to the end of the road paving. After paving the way out, the road
      turned into a narrow dirt road (footpath). Not long down the path, you
      arrived at a blank bale (gazebo) with Niagara Falls Sekumpul incredible
      lure.
