      Tanah Lot means "Land [in the] Sea" in the Balinese language.Located in
      Tabanan, about 20 kilometres (12 mi) North West of Denpasar, the temple
      sits on a large offshore rock which has been shaped continuously over the
      years by the ocean tide. Tanah Lot is claimed to be the work of the
      16th-century Dang Hyang Nirartha. During his travels along the south coast
      he saw the rock-island's beautiful setting and decided to rest there. Some
      fishermen saw him, and bought him gifts. Nirartha then spent the night on
      the little island. Later he spoke to the fishermen and told them to build
      a shrine on the rock, for he felt it to be a holy place to worship the
      Balinese sea gods.The main deity of the temple is Dewa Baruna or Bhatara
      Segara, who is the sea god or sea power and these days, Nirartha is also
      worshipped here.
