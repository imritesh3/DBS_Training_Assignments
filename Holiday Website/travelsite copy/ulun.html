      Pura Ulun Danu Beratan, or Pura Bratan, is a major Hindu Shaivite Shiva
      temple in Bali, Indonesia. The temple complex is on the shores of Lake
      Bratan in the mountains near Bedugul. The water from the lake serves the
      entire region in the outflow area; downstream there are many smaller water
      temples that are specific to each irrigation association.
