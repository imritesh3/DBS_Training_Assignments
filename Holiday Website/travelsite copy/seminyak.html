      Seminyak is a mixed tourist residential area on the west coast of Bali in
      Indonesia, just north of Kuta and Legian. Originally a separate township,
      this is now another suburb of Kuta. This area is very popular with
      resident expatriates and land and accommodation prices are amongst the
      highest in Bali. Plenty of luxury spas and hotels abound. Owing to its
      high density of high-end shopping, combined with the clustering of many
      fine eating establishments, it has rapidly become one of the most
      well-known tourist areas on the island. In addition to a few commercial
      strips with popular and lively restaurants, bars, villas, and good
      crafts/furniture shops, there are a few notable establishments: Ku DÃ© Ta,
      which is a bar/restaurant with a cult following based on its beach
      side/semi-resort atmosphere that has earned it the title of number one
      party spot in various magazines, and Oberoi, which is an expensive hotel
      with a worldwide reputation. Jalan Raya Seminyak (more often referred to
      as Jalan Legian), runs parallel with the beach, bisecting the district and
      acts as its main road artery.
